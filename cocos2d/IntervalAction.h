/** An interval action is an action that takes place within a certain period of time.
It has an start time, and a finish time. The finish time is the parameter
duration plus the start time.

These IntervalAction actions have some interesting properties, like:
 - They can run normally (default)
 - They can run reversed with the Reverse action.
 - They can run with the time altered with the Accelerate, AccelDeccel and Speed actions.

For example, you can simulate a Ping Pong effect running the action normally and
then running it again in Reverse mode.

Example:
 
	Action * pingPongAction = [Sequence actions: action, [action reverse], nil];
