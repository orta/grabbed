/** CocosNode is the main element. Anything thats gets drawn or contains things that get drawn is a CocosNode.
 The most popular CocosNodes are: Scene, Layer, Sprite.
 
 The main features of a cocosnode are:
 - They can contain other cocos nodes (add, get, remove, etc)
 - They can schedule periodic callback (schedule, unschedule, etc)
 - They can execute actions (do, pause, stop, etc)
 
 Some CocosNodes provide extra functionality for them or their children.
 
 Subclassing a CocosNode usually means (one/all) of:
 - overriding init to initialize resources and schedule calbacks
 - create callbacks to handle the advancement of time
 - overriding draw to render the node
